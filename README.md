Fix php 7 deprication method for mcrypt_encrypt


If you are willing to move you existing CI 2.6 project to php 7 then definitely you will face some deprication error as i faced too.
Here i have fixed mcrypt_encrypt related error in CI 2.6.


Replace Encrypt.php file with system/libraries/Encrypt.php.
